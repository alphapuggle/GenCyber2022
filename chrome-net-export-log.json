Logging is in progress writing data to:
    /home/chronos/u-f6babbc546ae387a6a7915d8f2b62ec408d20c8d/GCache/v1/files/e7fe3f3d-2734-4c2e-8c04-b1a2ac8c5896.inprogress

That data will be stitched into a single file (this one) once logging
has stopped.

If logging was interrupted, you can stitch a NetLog file out of the
.inprogress directory manually using:
